## 💡 Money Management Principles

### The 50/30/20 Rule (Modified for Tech)
```
High Earner Allocation:
├── 40% Needs (Housing, food, utilities, transportation)
├── 20% Wants (Entertainment, dining, hobbies)
└── 40% Savings & Investments (Emergency fund, 401k, investments)

├── 10% Wants (Selective spending)  
└── 60% Investments (Aggressive wealth building)
```

### Emergency Fund Sizing
- **Standard Rule**: 3-6 months of expenses
- **Tech Worker Rule**: 6-12 months (industry volatility)
- **High Earner Consideration**: Lifestyle inflation protection
- **Location Factor**: HCOL areas need larger funds

### Debt Management Priority
1. **High-Interest Debt** (Credit cards, personal loans): Pay off immediately
2. **Student Loans** (>6% interest): Aggressive payoff vs investment
3. **Mortgage** (Low interest): Consider opportunity cost
4. **Investment Leverage**: Advanced strategy, high risk

## 🚀 Advanced Strategies

### Tax-Loss Harvesting
```python
# Example: Tax-loss harvesting strategy
def tax_loss_harvest(portfolio, tax_year):
    """
    Identify losing positions for tax benefits
    Reinvest in similar (not identical) assets
    """
    losses = identify_losing_positions(portfolio)
    tax_savings = losses * marginal_tax_rate
    reinvest_proceeds(losses, similar_assets)
    return tax_savings
```

### Roth IRA Conversion Ladder
```
Strategy for Early Retirement:
Year 1: Convert $50K from 401k to Roth IRA (pay taxes)
Year 2: Convert $50K from 401k to Roth IRA (pay taxes)  
Year 3: Convert $50K from 401k to Roth IRA (pay taxes)
Year 6: Access Year 1 conversion penalty-free
Year 7: Access Year 2 conversion penalty-free
...
Result: Tax-free early retirement income
```
